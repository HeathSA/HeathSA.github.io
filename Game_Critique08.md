# Final Thoughts
The game is simple in concept. Controls are poor and do not allow the player to look around easily. 
The mouse gets stuck when turning left and right to see zombies, players can only make a 180 before getting stuck. 
Weapons are difficult to find and zombies are easy to outrun.
 Player can lock mouse to fix the initial turning problem, however the framrate becomes slow.
Zombies do not seem to have large hit boxes, nor do they have health giving the player no clue as to if they hit a zombie or not.
Animations, and graphics are fairly good, despite the lag. All around this game is a good prototype. The map is simple, and graphics good.
This is a solid playable game that could use a "wow" factor to push it over the edge.
