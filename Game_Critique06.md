# Synopsis
Solve Puzzles without breaking the egg.
# Game Play Summary
Players start off as an egg and attempt not to break. if you break, you become a chicken, which cannot navigate the level. Its jump is too low, and its harder to control.
## Playability
There appears to be no win condition, and the loose condition is unclear. The loose condition is getting stuck and being un-able to continue. There is no restart, or checkpoints. The game must be done from start to finish.
### Single/Multiplayer
Single Player
### Controls
Point-and-Click Only.
# Bugs
Bird player model jump is extremely varying. It is difficult to predict. The character may accidently float, or drop. there seems to be no factors that determine a float or a drop.  
# Final Thoughts
Interesting idea, though it is poorly executed. The lack of checkpoints and restart buttons leaves much to be desired. The game inself doesn't indicate how far you are from the goal, no matter how far you may get in it. The game appears endless, and if you are not careful you will have to start over again. Levels should be fully navigatable by the bird and the egg characters. Perhaps making one fast, and the other fly, would create a better balence.
