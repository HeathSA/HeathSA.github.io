# Final Thoughts
The game is simple in concept and easy to understand. Easily addicting game. The sound design is much too loud however. 
Controls are slightly off, and there appears to be no settings panel. Level code feature is a nice touch, allowing players to go to a specific level.
Colors and designs are clean and appealing. Overall, a well designed game, though it doesn't have a "Wow" Factor.
