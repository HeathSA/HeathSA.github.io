# Final Thoughts
The game is a great time waster. Good for story, and its completely free. You can buy your way through the game, 
but it is well designed so you don't have to spend your real money as long as you are patient. 
Not many limitations on this game, and they often give away free jewels to players for participation. 
The game is difficult and frustrating for players unfamiliar with the kingdom hearts series, but overall it is a fun game to play.
controls are quite easy, though the occasional bugs can cause the app to crash easily.
