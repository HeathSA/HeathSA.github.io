Starting with the initial Development, I would create a basic Pipeline after settling what the overall goal is for the programming team. I would create the basic skeleton of the code, and would have the beginning of the master branch completed. This would require basic testing and I feel that the Heroku automated testing could come in handy just to double check work before promoting the completed works to the QA environment. 
Shifting to the QA environment is the place where automated testing for the basic code will be checked. This assures that the master branch is as complete as it could possibly be, with the least amount of errors possible. This will give a cleaner template and will help to remove future issues, if later versions become corrupted. This is another part of development, but it is important before moving on to the staging. 
After QA is completed, I would want a period of review, to make sure that there are double checks on every section of the product. Automated testing cannot catch everything but I feel the human element and automated testing could complete the task together.
