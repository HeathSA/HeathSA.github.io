# Synopsis
Escape the Game and Solve the Problem.
# Game Play Summary
Escape the Cave along with various other areas by finding mterials and objects to craft with.
Each object belongs with something and is part of the bigger puzzle. 
It is somewhat linear in design though you can get objects out of order. 
Each puzzle requires different objects in order to complete it. 
## Playability
Game is fairly slow paced and gives you time to think. 
The game leans on your own observations and ability to observe things in the scene. 
It leaves visual queues to assist the player in finding the next object needed. 
### Single/Multiplayer
Single Player
### Controls
Point-and-Click Only.
# Bugs
Literal bugs were found in the game, other than those no major issues or problems with the overall functionality. 
# Final Thoughts
The cave is a simple game, that leaves much to be desired. 
Despite its visual queues it can be difficult to determine what you need to collect. Mini-games within the game itself make
things a little tedious, and all around visually it could use more clues for the player. The overall art style makes some objects unclear.
This adds to confusion, because the player cannot tell what it is they collected. Additionally, you must watch an add to gain a clue.
